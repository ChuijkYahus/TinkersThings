All generated textures exist inside of assets using the generate command.

See https://github.com/SlimeKnights/TinkersConstruct/wiki/Texture-Generators-%28Data-Packs%29 for more info.

See assets/tinkers_things/tinkering/generator_part_textures.json for a list of textures we generate variants for directly, though note our new materials will add some textures under tconstruct as well.
